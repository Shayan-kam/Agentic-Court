# 🏟️ Agentic-Court
> **Autonomous Intelligence for the Modern Game.**
> A multi-agent framework that reasons through player data to predict future performance.

## 🏀 The Vision
**Agentic-Court** is not a basic stat-tracker. It is an agentic AI ecosystem designed to simulate the decision-making process of a professional scout. By processing historical telemetry and in-game behavioral data, the model identifies the "hidden" trends that traditional box scores miss.

## 🤖 The Coaching Staff (Multi-Agent Architecture)
The "Court" is powered by three distinct autonomous agents:
* **The Scout Agent:** Interfaces with the `nba_api` to ingest raw career and game-log data.
* **The Analyst Agent:** Processes "actions" (usage rates, clutch performance, and efficiency splits) to find anomalies and growth patterns.
* **The Agent:** Synthesizes analysis into predictive reasoning, offering a "Coach's Report" on future performance.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Predictive Reasoning:** Goes beyond "what happened" to explain "what will happen" using agentic logic.
* **Action-Metric Analysis:** Focuses on high-impact player actions rather than just surface-level totals.
